Linear regression is used to model the relationship between two variables, where one variable (the dependent variable) is predicted based on the other variable (the independent variable). 
The equation for linear regression is 
Y = mX + b, where 
Y is the dependent variable, 
X is the independent variable,
m is the slope of the line(how much Y changes for one unit change in X), and 
b is the y-intercept(Value of Y when X is 0).

calculate m = Sum of product of deviation / sum of square of deviation of x
-> first calculate mean of X and Y variable.
-> calculate Deviation of X AND Y (X - MEAN OF X)...
-> CALCULATE product of deviation ( Deviation of X * Deviation of Y)
->sum the Product of deviation
-> square the deviation of X AND SUM IT. 

calculate b= Mean of Y - (m*Mean of X)

-> linear regression concepts involves refining and cleaning data to reduce errors, even though some errors may still occur due to outliers in the data.
